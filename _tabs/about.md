My name is Derrick Tran and I am a student from Cal Poly Pomona studying computer information systems. I am the Director of Marketing in SWIFT, Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology. Recently I have been rigorously studying penetration testing and have been developing my methodology to attack and compromize Linux and Windows systems. As of current, I have taken down 42 boxes on HackTheBox.

On my free time I like to play Minecraft, Terraria, ARK, or pretty much any sandbox suvival game. I grew up playing the Dragon Quest series so Jrpgs have a special place in my heart. An interesting fact about me is that I can name all of the pokemon up to Gen 5 in under half an hour. Aside from nerdy stuff, I also enjoy going to the gym with my friends and I try to swim whenever I get the chance to.

The purpose of this blog is meant to showcase my progress as I learn more about offensive security. For the most part, there will be plenty of HackTheBox writeups as that is what I dedicate most of my time to. Expect more writeups as boxes continue to get retired.
