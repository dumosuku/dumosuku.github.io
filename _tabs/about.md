My name is Derrick Tran and I am a student from Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Information Systems. I am the Director of Marketing in SWIFT, Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology.

On my free time I like to play Minecraft, Terraria, ARK, or pretty much any sandbox suvival game. I grew up playing the Dragon Quest series so Jrpgs have a special place in my heart. I also enjoy going to the gym with my friends and I try to swim whenever I get the chance to.

The purpose of this blog is meant to showcase my progress as I learn more about offensive security.
