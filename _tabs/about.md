Student from Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Information Systems. I am a member of the operations team in SWIFT, Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology.

I was first  introduced to the world of offensive security through my older cousin a few years back, but it was my younger brother who kicked me into gear. I've held the honor to compete with CPP Cyber at CPTC from 2022-2024 and CCDC from 2023-2024.

I got my handle from copying my cousin's Roblox name and replacing a single character. Really speaks to my level of creativity.

Here's a link to my [notes](https://dumosuku.notion.site/Public-Notes-787152d15e9f40b3a83b2989239c82f9) if you are interested.
