My name is Derrick Tran and I am a student from Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Information Systems. I am the Director of Marketing in SWIFT, Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology. I am currently interested in all things offensive security. I have experience testing webservers and basic Active Directory vulnerabilities. Currently I am interested in learning more about testing website APIs.

I got my handle from copying my cousin's Roblox name and replacing a single character. Really speaks to my level of creativity.
