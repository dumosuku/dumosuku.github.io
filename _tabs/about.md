I'm Derrick and I am a student from Cal Poly Pomona studying Computer Information Systems. I am the Director of Marketing in SWIFT, Students With an Interest in the Future of Technology. I enjoy playing sandbox survival / JRPG games or going to the gym to name a few hobbies.

I was first  introduced to the world of offensive security through my older cousin a few years back, but it was my younger brother who kicked me into gear. Now I am blessed with the opportunity to represent CPP as a member of their CPTC team. 

I got my handle from copying my cousin's Roblox name and replacing a single character. Really speaks to my level of creativity.

Here's a link to my [notes](https://succulent-lentil-32e.notion.site/Public-Notes-787152d15e9f40b3a83b2989239c82f9) if you are interested.
