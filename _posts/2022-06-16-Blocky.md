Blocky is a very short but sweet minecraft themed box. Not much enumeration is involved at all and this box can be finished in a matter of minutes. My biggest takeaway from this is learning how to use jd-gui to reverse .jar files.

The website seems minecraft themed. There's also a post by Notch. Maybe a user which could possibly be a user. Considering that we have ssh, we can keep this on the list to spray creds against. Its a wordpress site, wp scan time.

Nvm I wasted 20 min doing an aggresive scan, heres some interesting gobuster stuff instead. I searched for php extentions as well since I saw index.php

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.37 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x php`

While I didn't find any pluggins via wp-scan, the plugins folder may yield something.

I guess these werent picked up by wp-scan since these aren't built in? Either that or this is some sort of custom thing. Either way we might get something if we reverse these jar files.

Run `sudo -l`

Matching Defaults entries for notch on Blocky:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User notch may run the following commands on Blocky:

Looks like instant root. Being able to run bash with sudo means being able to spawn a root shell. Considering that we have Notch's password, consider this box pwned :)
