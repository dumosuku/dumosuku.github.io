Meta taught me a lot about how sudo and how it works. To gain shell on this box, we needed to upload a malicious pdf hosting our payload in the metadata. To pivot to user we needed to perform a technique similar to xxe and grab our vitcim's private key. As for the priviledge escelation, I needed to do research on how to abuse this command that we can run on sudo. Overall this box was not very realistic but it did teach me a lot of new things. Pretty happy to root my first medium box.

Based on info here, we see two files/directories getting automatically backed up or executed. To start, investigate convert_images.sh

```
cat /usr/local/bin/convert_images.sh 
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images/ && /usr/local/bin/mogrify -format png *.* 2>/dev/null
pkill mogrify
```

Mogrify is being executed to convert images. It is possible to read files using mogrify but only for certain versions.

`mogrify --version`
```

tl;dr of the post, we can use an svg file to get file read.

With file read, grab the ssh key of the user by putting this file into the folder where covert_images is being executed.

## Root
---
Refering back from earlier, neofetch's config is being backed up- a likely sign that this needs to be played with. It is not to be expected in a real environment but it seems like its going to be the key for this box.

Run `sudo -l`
```
Matching Defaults entries for thomas on meta:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME

User thomas may run the following commands on meta:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"
```
There is a GTFObin for sudo neofetch however, we can only run it with no arguments, ruining the easy root. So here's what I did instead.

> Note that XDG_CONFIG_HOME is being kept.
{: .prompt-tip }

This means we can pass the config file into the sudo environment. If we dont set the environment variable, this is what our output is when inserting whoami; id into the config file.

`neofetch`

``` 

Note that while running on sudo for those sweet root privileges, you don't get an output. We get output for the normal `neofetch` but obviously it is only ran as user and that isn't going to get us anywhere.

To correct this, export the config file into the environment variable, that way sudo runs with the actual config file.
`export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config`

Now run the sudo neofetch again
```

  `Y$$                                                     
   `Y$$.                                              
     `$$b.
       `Y$$b.
          `"Y$b._
              `"""
```

Now we can execute commands with root privileges.
Run a quick reverse shell.

```
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.102] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.140] 53764
# whoami
root
```

Finished my first medium :)

## Review
---
Heres some main takeaways from the box
### Sudo and how it works
Dylan mentioned that there is something called Principle of Least Privilege. What this means is that for good security practice, never do things with higher level privilges than you need. In short, run with the lowest level privileges to get the job done.

The output of sudo -l tells you a lot more than just what can be run as sudo. I learned that the environmental variable is something to be paid attention to. It also tells you HOW sudo will be ran. Lets look at the output from sudo -l again.
```bash
thomas@meta:~/.config/neofetch$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for thomas on meta:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME

User thomas may run the following commands on meta:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"
```
env_reset means, unless theres some exception, the environmental variables will not be inherited. This is for security reasons, you would not want something that can be ran as root to share variables set by a normal level user.

mail_badpass is just prompts you recieve when failing password authentication into sudo.

secure_path is the path of which sudo refers to. Unless $PATH is writtable, this isn't a vector to exploit.

env_keep+= ___, these are the exceptions mentioned earlier. These are the variables that are passed into sudo. In this case, we have XDG_CONFIG_HOME. This is a path that allows for user configs to be passed into sudo. In this box we had neofetch's config file that can be passed.

### Ssh keys
When it comes to methodology, stealing the ssh keys should be considered especially when you have file read. Remember that in this box, we had file read and we stole Thomas' ssh key to log in without a password. This is a viable and something worth noting since we were of a lower privilege user. Typically remote code execution into a reverse shell would be way I would privesc however, as far as i was aware, there was no RCE available to www-data. Using file read, steal ssh keys to log into user, perfectly good method.

### The utility of pspy
Pspy is short for process spy. It allows us to monitor processes as an unprivileged user. Pretty much a crontab viwer with no privileges, pretty nice. In meta, the main thing we saw was that there were files or directories that were constantly being backed up. This is a way for the box to not need a reset after people abused it. This means that these are most likely vectors to attack. This may not be as viable for real life however, its worth noting for hackthebox.

### RCE with file upload
Not the first time we saw this, Bounty Hunter and maybe Previse, if my memory serves me right, had it as well. This was the first time that it was using a malicious image to read the payload though.
